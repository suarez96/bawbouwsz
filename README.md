# BAWBOUWSZ
### A simple Game I Created in 2016 when I was learning javascript. 
The object is to match your current score (top number on the left div) to the target score (middle number) by popping the bubbles you hover over. When you pop a bubble, your score is modified by the number inside the bubble.<br>
To play: go to the github.io page which is posted [here](https://suarez96.github.io/).<br>
<em> Your fans might start whirring very loudly. That is a feature, not a bug <em>
