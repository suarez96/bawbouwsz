# BAWBOUWSZ
### A simple Game I Created in 2016 when I was learning javascript. 
![Gameplay](/res/gameplay.png)
The objective is to match your current score (top number on the left div) to the target score (middle number) by popping the bubbles you hover over. When you pop a bubble, your score is modified by the number inside the bubble. The bottom number on the left div is your countdown timer; you have 20 seconds to reach the target score, or you lose the game.<br>
